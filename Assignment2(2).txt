Summary : 

*When a webpage is loaded,the browser parses the HTML text and constructs DOM tree, then it process CSS and constructs the CSSOM tree.
*Then this DOM tree is converted into Render tree.
*The Render tree is actually divided four trees , they are,
=>RenderObjects
=>RenderStyles
=>RenderLayers
=>Line Boxes
*Then the browser creates layout of each individual Render-tree node.The layout consists of the size of each node in pixels.
*Then painting will actually produce an image of that layer and give you the output you are expecting on the page.
